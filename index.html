        <h3>Our Philosophy</h3>

        <h3>Diagnosis</h3>
        <p>We believe that your worries, your questions, your symptoms and your quality of life come first.</p>
        <p>Our approach starts with listening carefully and empathically to your medical history; we record your symptoms and expectations in details, and we proceed with specific questions which will bring us to a diagnosis.</p>
        <p>Gynaecological examination and ultrasound are essential components of our specialised service to investigate your symptoms and potential pathologies correlated.</p>

        <h3>Treatments</h3>
        <p>After our diagnostic pathway, we can discuss treatment options with you and make the right decision for you and your symptoms.</p>
        <p>If surgery is indicated in your case, a further explanation on risks and benefit will be carried over.</p>
        <p>We perform minimally invasive surgery and only in very specific cases we proceed with open surgery. If any investigations or treatments inside the uterine cavity are needed, we perform a procedure called hysteroscopy.</p>
