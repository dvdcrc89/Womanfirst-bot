  <meta property=”og:description” content="Request an appointment today!Laparoscopy is a type of surgical procedure that allows a surgeon to access the inside of the abdomen and pelvis without having to make large incisions in the skin. This procedure is also known as keyhole surgery or minimally invasive surgery. The surgeon uses an instrument called a laparoscope. This is a small tube that has a light source and a camera, which relays images of the inside of the abdomen or pelvis to a television monitor. The advantages of this technique over traditional open surgery include a shorter hospital stays and faster recovery time, less pain and bleeding after the operation and reduced scarring." />

                <p>Our approach starts with listening carefully and empathically to your medical history; we record your symptoms and expectations in details, and we proceed with specific questions which will bring us to a diagnosis.</p>
                <p>Gynaecological examination and ultrasound are essential components of our specialised service to investigate your symptoms and potential pathologies correlated.</p>

                <p>If surgery is indicated in your case, a further explanation on risks and benefit will be carried over.</p>
                <p>We perform minimally invasive surgery and only in very specific cases we proceed with open surgery. If any investigations or treatments inside the uterine cavity are needed, we perform a procedure called hysteroscopy.</p>
