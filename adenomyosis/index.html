                <p>Adenomyosis is a condition in which the inner lining of the uterus breaks through the muscle wall of the uterus. It can cause menstrual cramps, lower abdominal pressure, and bloating before menstrual periods and can result in heavy periods.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
                <p>The cause of adenomyosis remains unknown, but the disease usually resolves after menopause. However, we do know that women who have had children and women who also have endometriosis are more at risk.eriods.</p>

                <p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
                <p>Adenomyosis is a common condition. It is most often diagnosed in middle-aged women and women who have had children. Some studies also suggest that women who have had prior uterine surgery may be at risk for adenomyosis. It is commonly associated with endometriosis, and both conditions cause painful periods and painful sex. The difference is that in endometriosis the patches of endometrial lining are found outside the womb and in adenomyosis, they are within the walls of the uterus.</p>

                <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
                <p>Adenomyosis may be difficult to diagnose. A pelvic exam reveals an enlarged and tender uterus. The main test recommended is a transvaginal ultrasound (the ultrasound probe is placed in the vagina). The test should preferably be performed by a gynaecologist who specialises in ultrasound, as general ultrasonagraphers may be inexperienced in the diagnosis of adenomyosis. However, in situations where the diagnosis is unclear, a MRI may be required. In the other hand, the only way to be certain of adenomyosis is to examine uterine tissue using a microscope after removal of the uterus (hysterectomy). The treatment is usually symptomatic. This includes the use of anti-inflammatory medications for symptomatic relief. Hormonal treatment for control of bleeding. Hysterectomy is the surgical treatment and it is a reasonable option for women who have completed child bearing.</p>
