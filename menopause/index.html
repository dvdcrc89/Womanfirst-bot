                <p><strong>What?</strong></p>
                <p>Menopause is a natural biological process that usually occurs between 45 and 55 years of age. In the UK, the average age for a woman to reach the menopause is 51.use.</p>

                <p><strong>Why?</strong></p>
                <p>A woman is born with a finite number of eggs, which are stored in the ovaries. The ovaries also make the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, which control menstruation and ovulation. In menopause, menstruation stops and oestrogen levels decline. A woman can experience physical symptoms, such as hot flashes, and emotional symptoms of menopause which may disrupt sleep, lower energy or affect emotional health. There are many effective treatments available, from lifestyle adjustments to hormone therapy.</p>

                <p><strong>Who?</strong></p>
                <p>Menopause is the time that marks the end of your menstrual cycles. It generally happens in your 40s or 50s; however, in some instances, it happens earlier. When this occurs before the age of 40, it's called premature ovarian failure. Unlike early menopause, premature ovarian failure is not always permanent. About 8 in every 10 women will have additional symptoms for some time before and after their periods stop.</p>

                <p><strong>How?</strong></p>
                <p>Signs and symptoms of menopause are usually enough to tell most women that they have started the menopausal transition. Menopause requires no medical treatment. We can offer treatments and suggest lifestyle changes if you have severe menopausal symptoms that interfere with your day-to-day life. There are several options to consider, such as hormone replacement therapy which can relieve menopausal symptoms by replacing oestrogen; a balanced diet and regular exercises and cognitive behavioural therapy which will help with low mood and anxiety;</p>
